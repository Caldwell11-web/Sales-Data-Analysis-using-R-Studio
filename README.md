# Sales-Data-Analysis-using-R-Studio
I worked on Sales dataset from Kaggle using R Studio and here is a quick overview of what I did;
 
  -Data Cleaning and Transformation
 
  -Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
 
  -Linear Reggresion Model to predict Sales Amount
 
  -Converted data into a time series format to capture patterns over time
 
  -Build and tuned an ARIMA model to forecast sales fpr the next 30 days
 
  -Visualized the forecast to highlight expected sales trends and uncertainty
 
  -Drawing conclusions and summarizing insights from the analysis

This analysis helps provide actionable insights for better sales planing and decision-making. It's always rewarding to turn raw data into clear, data-driven recommendations.
